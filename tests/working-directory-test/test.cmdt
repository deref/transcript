# Test working directory behavior
# 
# This test validates that:
# 1. Transcript inherits the working directory from the process that launches it
# 2. Directory changes with 'cd' persist within a transcript session
# 3. Relative paths work correctly from changed directories
# 4. Complex commands work across directory changes

# Test: Check that we start in the working-directory-test directory  
$ basename "$(pwd)"
1 working-directory-test

# Test: Navigate to existing test directory
$ cd wd-test

# Test: Verify directory change persisted and relative paths work
$ basename "$(pwd)"
1 wd-test
$ cat test-file.txt
1 test content
% no-newline

# Test: Navigate deeper and verify relative access to parent
$ cd subdir
$ basename "$(pwd)"
1 subdir
$ cat ../test-file.txt
1 test content
% no-newline

# Test: Complex commands with directory context
$ cd .. && echo "$(basename $(pwd)): $(cat test-file.txt | wc -w | tr -d ' ')"
1 wd-test: 2

# Test: Return to working-directory-test directory
$ cd ..
$ basename "$(pwd)"
