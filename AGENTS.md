# Building & Testing

- Build with `./build.sh` instead of using `go build` directly.
- .cmdt files use the Command Transcript language implemented by this project.
  Consult @docs/reference.md for the syntax and @tests/\*.cmdt for examples.
- Always test using ./test.sh from the root directory.

# Style & Conventions

- Soft-wrap markdown files at 80 columns.
